# 🐳 Dockerized Full Stack Sample App

Hi, I'm **Saad Ur Rehman** 👋 — a Full Stack Developer passionate about building scalable web applications.  
This is a sample project I created to explore Docker integration with different JavaScript-based stacks including **React**, **Next.js**, and the **MERN** stack.

This project serves as a template and learning reference for containerizing frontend and backend applications using Docker and Docker Compose.

---

## 🚀 Stacks Included

- ⚛️ **React** – Frontend SPA
- ⚡ **Next.js** – Full-stack framework with SSR
- 🌿 **MERN** – MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (complete full stack)

---

## 🛠️ Key Features

- Dockerized development environment
- Separate containers for frontend, backend, and database
- Pre-configured Docker Compose setup
- Live reload support for React, Next.js, and Node.js
- MongoDB service included for the MERN stack
- Modular, easy-to-navigate folder structure

---

## 🧪 How to Run

Each stack has its own Docker setup. Navigate into the stack you want to run and follow the instructions below:

### ▶ React App

```bash
cd react-app
docker-compose up --build
```

---

### ▶ Next.js App

```bash
cd nextjs-app
docker-compose up --build
```

---

### ▶ MERN Stack App

```bash
cd mern-app
docker-compose up --build
```

---

## 🎯 Why I Built This

As a full stack developer, I wanted to create a hands-on project to:

- Understand how Docker works across different JS frameworks
- Set up isolated, reproducible development environments
- Learn best practices in containerization and multi-service orchestration

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Add production-ready Dockerfiles with Nginx reverse proxy
- Volume mapping for persistent database data
- CI/CD pipeline integration using GitHub Actions
- Add sample MongoDB seed data
